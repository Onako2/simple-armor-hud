## Announcement
At the moment, there is a request running to make the armor placement configurable ([#11](https://github.com/legoraft/simple-armor-hud/issues/11)). As said in the bug report, I'll try to implement this. At the moment life is quite busy for me, meaning I won't implement any major changes to the mod. The mod will be kept up to date with the current features and small bugs will still be smashed. The bigger update with configurable placement will be postponed until I have more time.

## Information

### Features
This mod shows your armor above the foodbar in the in-game hud. Also moves armor up when underwater and down when in creative. <br>

### Dependencies
Simple armor hud doesn't require any other mods.

### Installation
Releases for the mod are found on [Modrinth](https://modrinth.com/mod/simple-armor-hud/), [Releases](https://github.com/LegoRaft/simple-armor-hud/releases) and on [Curseforge](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/simple-armor-hud). <br>
For an installation tutorial, go [here](https://fabricmc.net/wiki/install). Note: Simple armor hud **doesn't require** the Fabric API

### Build

You can also build the mod directly from the github repository. <br>
For this, download or clone the github repository. <br>
Next, go to the directory with `cd user/directory/mod` (where you use the actual directories where the mod is stored, this is just an example.) <br>
After this, run `gradlew build`. <br>
When the task is completed, go to the 'build' and the 'libs' folders, and drag the simple-armor-hud-1.x.x-x.x.x file to your mods folder. Ignore the -dev, -sources and -sources-dev files, you can delete these.
